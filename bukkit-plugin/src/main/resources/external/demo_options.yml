# Brainstorming Rule Options for LM 4.
options:

  # If the rule is ran (conditions are valid),
  # and once its actions are ran, should no further
  # rules be processed for the mob?
  #
  # Default: false = continue processing
  #
  # Has priority over 'skip-to'.
  stop-processing: true

  # If the rule is ran, when complete,
  # skip to another rule rather than
  # go to the next rule in order.
  #
  # You can only skip to rules that are
  # specified in the configuration *after*
  # this one. This prevents circular loops
  # from forming by using the skip-to feature.
  # This is up for change, I can instead just
  # add circular rule detection and make
  # this protection/limitation no longer exist.
  # Or, we can just have a setting that
  # disables the circular loop protection.
  #
  # Default: '' (empty string) = don't skip to any rules
  #
  # 'stop-processing' has priority over this.
  skip-to: 'rule-name-here'
