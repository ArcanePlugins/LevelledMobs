# - Adjust the default multiplier values; play-test them
# - Write buffs list for other presets

# Welcome to the presets file! Here you can reduce the amount of boilerplate
# you need to write in the functions system as presets essentially act as
# 'copy and paste' bits for your functions. It can also be used to tidy up
# some large ugly parts from your functions configuration so that your
# settings file is easier to edit and understand. Define as many presets
# as you need to.

        # Should LevelledMobs adjust the mob's current health
        # to match the previous health percentage they had,
        # in accordance with their newfound max health value?
        # This does not plainly reset their health, it tries to
        # match the health ratio that the mob previously had.
        #
        # e.g. if a zombie spawns with 20/20HP, and its max health
        # is set to 40HP, as the health percentage is 100% (20/20=100),
        # then the zombie's current health will also be 40hp.
        # Say that the zombie was damaged in a fight, it is now 10/40HP,
        # and then its max health gets changed back to 20HP, so
        # 10/40 is 25%, so the zombie's current health will be set to
        # 5HP (now totalling 5HP out of 20HP).
