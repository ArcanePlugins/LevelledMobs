/**
 * This module provides code that allows for very simple
 * integrations to LevelledMobs. This package is completely
 * separate from the LevelledMobs plugin, it only uses Bukkit
 * methods to access LevelledMobs values. Small, lightweight
 * and very easy to use. Hence, this module is suffixed 'lite'.
