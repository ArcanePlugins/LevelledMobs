# Brainstorming Rule Conditions for LM 4.
conditions:

  #########
  ### NOTES
  #########
  #
  # - AVAILABLE EVENTS LIST
  #   Not every condition is applicable to every event (e.g. EntitySpawn).
  #   A list of available events is supplied with each Condition so you
  #   know which events you can use this Condition for! :D
  #
  # - SHORT/LONG VERSIONS OF CONDITIONS
  #   Each condition, wherever feasible, will have a short version
  #   of the normal (long) version. This helps simplify longer files
  #   and remove repetitive boilerplate. The longer versions are
  #   arguably more readable, so it is recommended to use the long
  #   version wherever it is feasible for the user.
  #
  # - GRAVE SYMBOL (`) IN KEYS, IN THE BRAINSTORMING FILE
  #   To prevent errors in the editor from duplicate YAML
  #   keys, the grave symbol (`) is added to prevent duplicate
  #   keys from existing. Of course these duplicate keys will
  #   not happen in the actual file, and these symbols are not
  #   used in the real file.
  #
  # - INCLUSIVE/EXCLUSIVE PRIORITY
  #   Inclusive lists have priority over exclusive lists.
  #
  # - INVERSING CONDITIONS
  #   All block-conditions (not short hand versions!) have
  #   a boolean called 'inverse'. This inverts the boolean
  #   output of the condition. This can be used in funky ways
  #   e.g. using an inclusive list but inverting it so it is
  #   actually exclusive ;) of course this is not intended,
  #   it is meant to be used for conditions that don't have
  #   incl/excl functionality.
  #   This is per-condition! Not per-rule.

  #############
  # ENTITY TYPE
  #############
  #
  # Available Events:
  #  All mob-based events.
  #
  # Description:
  #  Specify a list of Entity Types which are required
  #  for the rule to be processed.

  # short
  entity-type-incl: ['CREEPER'] # Set<String>
  entity-type-excl: ['CREEPER'] # Set<String>

  # long
  entity-type:
    inclusive-list: ['CREEPER'] # Set<String>
    # OR
    exclusive-list: ['CREEPER'] # Set<String>

  ###########
  # MOB GROUP
  ###########
  #
  # Available Events:
  #  All mob-based events.
  #
  # Description:
  #  This condition allows you to factor in the presence
  #  of the mob's entity type in any of the specified mob
  #  groups.
  #  (Groups are those defined in groups.yml)

  # short
  mob-group-incl: ['passives'] # Set<String>
  mob-group-excl: ['hostiles'] # Set<String>

  # long
  mob-group:
    inclusive-list: ['passives'] # Set<String>
    # OR
    exclusive-list: ['hostiles'] # Set<String>

  ####################
  # MOB LEVELLED STATE
  ####################
  #
  # Available Events:
  #  All mob-based events.
  #
  # Description:
  #  Specify whether the mob should be levelled/not levelled
  #  or if this should be ignored.
  #  'ANY' = the mob can be levelled or not levelled (default)
  #  'YES' = the mob must be levelled
  #  'NO'  = the mob must not be levelled

  # short (no long version)
  levelled-state: 'ANY' # LevelledState

  ########################
  # LIGHT LEVEL FROM BLOCK
  ########################
  #
  # Available Events:
  #  All player-based or mob-based events.
  #
  # Description:
  #  Specify a min-to-max requirement of what the mob's
  #  current location's block's light level is for the rule.
  #
  #  Light level from blocks is not the same as light level from the sky!
  #
  #  A short, non-ranged version will not be added. it'll
  #  just bloat the parser and be harder to use anyways.
  #  Just use the short-ranged or long verison.

  # short
  light-level-from-block: '3-5' # RangedInt

  # long
  light-level-from-block`:
    min: 3 # int
    max: 5 # int

  ######################
  # LIGHT LEVEL FROM SKY
  ######################
  #
  # Available Events:
  #  All player-based or mob-based events.
  #
  # Description:
  #  Specify a min-max requirement of what the mob's
  #  current location's sky light level is for that rule.
  #
  #  Light level from the sky is not the same as light level from blocks!
  #
  #  Same layout as the light level from block condition. See that condition's
  #  brainstorming comments for more information.

  # short
  light-level-from-sky: '3-5' # RangedInt

  # long
  light-level-from-sky`:
    min: 3 # int
    max: 5 # int

  ####################
  # MODIFIED BY PLUGIN
  ####################
  #
  # Available Events:
  #  All mob-based events.
  #
  # Description:
  #  Checks if the mob is modified/managed by a compatible Mob Owner plugin.
  #  What's a Mob Owner?
  #   LevelledMobs defines a Mob Owner as a plugin which modifies mobs.
  #   LevelledMobs itself is a Mob Owner.
  #   Mob Owners are usually understood through an integration from
  #   LevelledMobs itself, e.g. for MythicMobs and EliteMobs. However,
  #   it is possible for plugins to register themselves as mob owners too!
  #   This can also allow them to bring greater degrees of integration with
  #   their plugin, if they desire.
  #   It's possible for a mob to have multiple Mob Owners, but it's rare since
  #   plugins usually want sole control over certain mobs.
  #
  # What's this condition?
  #  This condition checks if a mob belongs to a Mob Owner as specified
  #  by the configurator.

  # short
  modified-by-plugin-incl: ['MYTHIC_MOBS', 'ELITE_MOBS', 'INFERNAL_MOBS'] # Set<String>
  modified-by-plugin-excl: ['CITIZENS', 'SHOPKEEPERS', 'VANILLA_BOSSES'] # Set<String>

  # long

    inclusive-list: [] # Set<String>
    # OR
    exclusive-list: [] # Set<String>

  ##########################
  # MYTHICMOBS INTERNAL NAME
  ##########################
  #
  # Available Events:
  #  All mob-based events,
  #
  # Description:
  #  If MythicMobs is installed, the user can make a condition that
  #  requires a name from the list (inclusive/exclusive) to be met.
  #  The name is from MythicMobs, e.g. 'Skeleton King'.

  # short
  mythicmobs-internal-name-incl: ['Skeleton King'] # Set<String>
  mythicmobs-internal-name-excl: ['Skeletal Minion'] # Set<String>

  # long
  mythicmobs-internal-name:
    inclusive-list: [] # Set<String>
    # OR

  ##############
  # SPAWN REASON
