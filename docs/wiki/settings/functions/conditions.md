# âœ… Conditions in the Functions System

Conditions are components which 'check things' in the [Functions System](functions.md).

You can use Conditions in [Processes](functions.md#Processes) to make its respective list of [Actions](actions.md) only be ran, only if the defined list of Conditions are met.

For instance, you can use the 'Entity Type' condition to make a Process only run its Actions if the entity in its context is a Creeper. This example was explored in the [Processes](functions.md#Processes) description in this Wiki, where we used entity types to use particular logic for Withers, and different logic for all other entities.
