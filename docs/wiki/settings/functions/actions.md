# üîÅ Actions in the Functions System

Actions are components which 'do things' in the [Functions System](functions.md).

It can be thought of something that can be *ran* to achieve a result on the server.  For example, the 'Broadcast Message to Server' Action gives you the ability to specify a message to broadcast to all online players in their chat box.

Actions are defined within [Processes](functions.md#Processes). Whenever the parent Process is ran, assuming the [Conditions](conditions.md) within the same Process are met, all of the Actions in the Process are ran.
