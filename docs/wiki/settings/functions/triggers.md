# ⚠️ Triggers in the Functions System

Triggers are 'events' which happen on the server, such as a player joining, an entity being spawned in, a player teleporting, and so on.

[Functions](functions.md) can be called automatically when a Trigger happens on the server. In the default [Settings](../settings.md) file, for example, the first function is called by two triggers, one of those being 'On Entity Spawn'.
