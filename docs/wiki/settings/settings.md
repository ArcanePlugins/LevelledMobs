# üõ†Ô∏è Settings

> **Looking to configure LevelledMobs?** You'll want to customise the [Functions System](functions/functions.md), which you can do inside this file. Check that page out to learn how to use it.

The Settings file is the primary area where you configure the LevelledMobs plugin. 

Most of this file's purpose is to customise the [Functions System](functions/functions.md),
which allows you to change how LevelledMobs works.

You can also customise which [Translation](../translations/translations.md) you want to use, and you can use various [Advanced Settings](../advanced/advanced-settings.md) (at your risk).
