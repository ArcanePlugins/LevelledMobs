conditions:
  # Which entity types are valid for the rule to run
  entity-type:
    inclusive-list: ['CREEPER']
    # OR
    exclusive-list: ['CREEPER']

    inverse: false
    # EVERY condition has an inverse switch
    # funnily enough this can be combined to make inclusive lists actually exclusive
    # unsure if we should remove modal lists because of this? users tend to get confused
    # about them as well.

  # If the rule cares about the mob being levelled
  is-levelled:
    state: 'ANY'
    # 'ANY' = the mob can be levelled or not levelled (default)
    # 'YES' = the mob requires a level for the rule to run
    # 'NO' = vice versa of 'YES'
