# Brainstorming Rule Actions for LM 4.
actions:

  #########
  # EXECUTE
  #########
  #
  ### ABOUT THE 'EXECUTABLES' SYSTEM:
  # This is an action which makes a lot of cool things possible!
  # In LevelledMobs 4, there is a hidden system called Executables.
  # This allows developers, even through other plugins, to create
  # code that can run when told to by the rules system (just in
  # the action below!). By default there is 'update-nametags', which
  # will be explained below. However, developers can add things like
  # 'cast-spell' or 'cast-fireball', whatever they want!
  #
  ## EXECUTABLE 'ARGUMENTS' SYSTEM:
  # Executables can also be paired with 'arguments', to specify some
  # more information to run the executable with. The update-nametag
  # executable does not have any arguments available although an example
  # would be: 'update-nametag:firstarg:second arg:third argument 123:hello there!'
  # So the update-nametag executable will be ran with the arguments:
  # 'firstarg', 'second arg', 'third argument 123', and 'hello there!'.
  # Just like commands, but instead of spaces, they are separated using colons. :)
  #
  ### EXECUTABLES LIST (by default):
  #
  ## 'update-nametag':
  # When ran on a player-based event, it will update the nametag of each
  # entity around them. This radius is configured in the settings.yml file,
  # same as in LevelledMobs 3.
  # When ran on an entity-based event, it will update the nametag of the
  # entity involved in the event. This nametag packet will be sent to all
  # players around the mob, in the same radius which was elaborated on above.
  execute: ['update-nametag'] # LinkedList<String>
