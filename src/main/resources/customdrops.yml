#                     The Ultimate RPG Levelled Mobs Solution
#
# This is the custom drops configuration where you can make mobs drop items of your choice.
# Thanks to stumper66 for creating this system!

# Attributes available:
#
# minlevel - the minimal mob level required to drop this item
# maxlevel - the maximum mob level that can drop this item
# chance - a value to determine how likely the mob is to drop this item.  1.0 = 100%, 0.1 = 10%, etc
# amount - how many of this item will be dropped
# nomultiplier: - the level of the mob will not affect the amount dropped - !!!! make sure you end it with ":", as in: nomultiplier:
# enchantments - enter a list of enchantments the item will have and the enchantment level
# groupid - if multiple items for the same mob have the same groupid, one one of the items will be dropped

# universal groups - instead of specifying items for a specific mob you can use the following universal groups:
#
# all_mobs, all_levellable_mobs, all_hostile_mobs, all_passive_mobs, all_overworld_mobs, all_nether_mobs,
# all_flying_mobs, all_ground_mobs, all_aquatic_mobs
