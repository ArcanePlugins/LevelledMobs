#                     The Ultimate RPG Levelled Mobs Solution
#
# This is the custom drops configuration where you can make mobs drop items of your choice.
# Thanks to stumper66 for creating this system!
#
# ***** IMPORTANT NOTE! *****
# To use utilize this file, edit settings.yml and change this value to true: use-custom-item-drops-for-mobs

# Attributes available:
#
# minlevel - the minimal mob level required to drop this item
# maxlevel - the maximum mob level that can drop this item
# chance - a value to determine how likely the mob is to drop this item.  1.0 = 100%, 0.1 = 10%, etc.
#          If no chance is specified then the default of 0.2 will be used
# amount - how many of this item will be dropped.  This can be a number or a number range.  Example: 2-4
# nomultiplier: true - the level of the mob will not affect the amount dropped
# nospawner: true - if specified then any mobs created by a spawner will not drop the custom item
# enchantments - enter a list of enchantments the item will have and the enchantment level.  Example: unbreaking: 3
# groupid - if multiple items for the same mob have the same groupid, one one of the items will be dropped
# lore - enter a list of strings to use for the lore
# damage: amount - enter the amount of damage the item will start with

# universal groups - instead of specifying items for a specific mob you can use the following universal groups:
#
# all_mobs, all_levellable_mobs, all_hostile_mobs, all_passive_mobs, all_overworld_mobs, all_nether_mobs,
# all_flying_mobs, all_ground_mobs, all_aquatic_mobs

# Don't change this unless you know what you're doing!
