# || IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT USING LEVELLEDMOBS CUSTOMDROPS
# || 
# || To utilize this file, you must first edit settings.yml
# || Locate 'use-custom-item-drops-for-mobs' and change it's
# || value to 'true' instead of the default 'false'.
# ||

# ||  Preface - Attributes and Universal Groups
# |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
# 
# ||-------------------------------------------------------||
#     Each individual mob or universal group can utilize the
#     following attributes to customize their drops upon
#     death. There are various examples using each available
#     attribute located at the end of this file in the
#     Section 05 - Demonstrations.
#
#     For your convenience, we have included various Universal
#     Groups of mobs to use instead of EntityType in order to
#     make changes to multiple mobs of a type at once. These
#     Universal Groups are listed below after the attributes.
#
#     Finally, in Section 03 - Loot Tables, you will find the
#     tools needed to craft drop-tables of items with their own
#     parameters to apply to any EntityType or Universal Group.
#     It is quite complex and meant for advanced users only.
#
#     NOTE: Unless 'override' is set for the drops, the EntityType
#     will still process it's vanilla Minecraft drops alongside
#     the custom drops.
#
# ||--A] Customizable Attributes
#
#      EntityType:
#            | Reference 
#            | https://tinyurl.com/SpigotMCEntityTypes
#            | For proper mob names to use in place
#            | of 'EntityType'.
#            | You may select multiple EntityTypes by separating
#            | each with a semicolon. For example:
#            | ZOMBIE;SKELETON;HUSK
#        - MATERIAL:
#             | The material item you wish to drop on the mobs death.
#             | Reference https://tinyurl.com/MCMaterials
#             | For proper material names to use in place
#             | of 'MATERIAL' above. Any material marked
#             | as 'Depreciated' is no longer functioning.
#          minlevel:
#              | The minimum level to apply the custom drops.
#          maxlevel:
#              | The maximum level to apply the custom drops.
#          chance:
#              | The percent chance of the drop occurring,
#              | converted to decimal. For example:
#              | 0.01 is 1%; 0.1 is 10%; 0.5 is 50%; 1.0 is 100%
#              | If no chance is set, a default of 20% (0.2) is used.
#          amount:
#              | The amount of the drop, should it occur. You
#              | are able to create a spread of possible amounts.
#              | For example: 1 is one drop; 1-3 is one, two, or
#              | three drops; 2-4 is two, three, or four drops.
#              | If there is a spread, the drop quantity will
#              | randomly select one of the values.
#          nomultiplier: 
#             true | If, in settings.yml, the EntityType's 'item-drop'
#                  | is activated, this will prevent any items under this
#                  | EntityType's customized drops from being multiplied.
#            false | Any drops from the custom drops will be multiplied
#                  | according to your 'item-drop' settings and the
#                  | mobs current level. (Default)
#          nospawner: 
#             true | If set to true, any mob spawned from a Mob Spawner
#                  | will not have the custom drops applied to them.
#            false | If set to false, any mob matching the EntityType
#                  | will have the custom drops apply.
#          enchantments: 
#            ENCHANTMENT: X
#              | The enchantment formatting is fairly simple: You'll need
#              | the enchantment name and it's strength. This system can
#              | create 'unsafe' enchantments, which are considered any
#              | enchantment outside of Minecraft's vanilla values.
#              | Reference https://tinyurl.com/MCEnchantments
#              | for a list of vanilla enchantments to use instead of
#              | the 'ENCHANTMENT' above. The strength value is represented
#              | by the 'X'. You should be able to use popular custom
#              | enchantment plugins, though compatitbility is not guarenteed.
#          lore:
#            - 'This is some &6lore'
#            - 'Applied to the item'
#               | Above is an example of two separate lines of lore.
#               | Ensure you follow the formatting shown above.
#               | You are able to include Minecraft's color codes as well.
#          name: 'Material Name'
#              | Giving the material a custom name.
#              | You are able to include Minecraft's color codes as well.
#          damage:
#              | Used to apply durability damage to the item before it
#              | drops. This value can be a spread, for example:
#              | 100-500 would allow for durability damage at any
#              | value within that range. If you want to apply able
#              | single static value, just put the amount rather than
#              | apply the spread. Ensure you understand how Minecraft's
#              | item durability system works before using this value!
#          equipped:
#             true | If set to true, the mob will attempt to equip the
#                  | item it has spawned with. This is most useful for
#                  | weapons, armor, and potions, though it will attempt
#                  | to equipt any item into it's hand. Remember...
#                  | Most mobs have either two hands or no hands!
#            false | If set to false, the mob will simply hold the drops
#                  | in their inventory to be dropped upon death.
#                  | This is set to false by default.
#          override:
#             true | If set to true, the mob will not drop it's vanilla
#                  | drops, and will instead reference this custom drops
#                  | list for any potential drops it could have.
#            false | If set to false, the mob will process it's own vanilla
#                  | drops, and then process the custom drops separately.
#          custommodeldata:
#                  | This is used in conjunction with custom resource packs
#                  | and allows you to utilize them in your custom drop.
#                  | must be following by an id.
#                  | Reference https://tinyurl.com/hhzkuxk8
#          groupid:
#                  | By placing multiple items within the same groupid, you
#                  | are establishing 'sets' of drops which are processed as
#                  | a group. If the mob has dropped one of the items in the
#                  | set, it will ignore the other options and process the rest.
#                  | An example of how this might work would be if you had
#                  | set an EntityType to drop an IRON_BLOCK, GOLD_BLOCK, and
#                  | DIAMOND_BLOCK, placing each item into the same groupid.
#                  | Upon death, if you would have received any two or more items,
#                  | you will only receive one of the drops; randomly selected.
#                  | This is useful for establishing a form of loot tables.

#

#       | The groups below can be used in place
#       | of the EntityType in order to select
#       | groups of mobs at a time.

# ||  Drop Table System
#
#     This system allows you to establish sets of items, each
#     with their own drop parameters, to apply to an EntityType
#     or Universal Group. This makes applying multiple items
#     or tables to an EntityType easy by transforming the set
#     to a single line of configuration, making for less
#     copy/paste and more flexibility in making large changes
#     across multiple EntityTypes or Universal Groups.
#
#     Please reference 'Customizable Attributes' in the preface
#     at the top of this file for crafting a custom drop to
#     add to your drop table. There are examples in the
#     Section 05 - Demonstrations below. You my use a numbered list
#     or give each table it's own title. You may override any
#     drop attribute of specific items by specifying it after
#     'usedroptable:' within an EntityType or Universal Group.
