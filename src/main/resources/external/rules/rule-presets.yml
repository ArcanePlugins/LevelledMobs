# LM 3's rules file is available at: https://github.com/lokka30/LevelledMobs/blob/master/src/main/resources/rules.yml

# Presets act as 'copy and pastes' for the rules file.
# Presets can only be specified at the base of the rule, i.e., not under an action or condition etc.
presets:    
  'no-level':
    actions:
      levelling:
        formula: 'none'
        # It is now impossible for mobs to be 'level 0', if a mob's level is calculated to be below 1, then LM will automatically
        # set the level to 1.
        # To make a mob 'not levelled', the levelling formula needs to be set to 'none'. See the 'no-level' preset for example usage.
      matched-actions: # Matched actions makes the rule also apply to babies/passengers regardless of any conditions they have.
        babies: true
        passengers: false
    once-processed:
      stop-processing: true # This makes the rules interpreter no longer check further rules once this has been reached and the conditions are true of course.
  
  'normal-difficulty':
#   I won't include easy/hard difficulties in this example file, doing so will just create clutter.
    actions:
      levelling:
        formula: '%weighted-random%'
#       Levelling variance has been removed as this can be achieved in the new 'levelling formula' system - just use a placeholder
#       that generates random numbers.  
        strategies:
          weighted-random:
            weightings:
              1-20: 5
              21-40: 4
              41-60: 3
              61-80: 2
              81-100: 1 # changing max level to 100. can't remember why we chose 25 but I don't really like that number
                        # for being a max level. More numbers also means smoother attribute transitions between each level.
