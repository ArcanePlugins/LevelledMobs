# ||  LevelledMob's '/lm summon' command per use. This would be useful to help limit any        |

# ||  On some servers, PLAYER_HEADS are too valuable of a resource to be multiplied             |
# ||  with the standard item drops. That is why this setting exists: to decide                  |
# ||  whether you want head/skull drops to be multiplied alongside the item multiplier.         |

# ||  This setting helps prevent your server from crashing due to a sudden influx of commands   |
# ||  being run repeatedly. If you specify an 'amount:' within a CustomCommand drop, and that   |
# ||  value is higher than this limiter, it will instead use the limit.                         |
# ||                                                                                            |

# ||     | This will put an optional delay for when LevelledMobs processed a                    |
# ||     | mob.  Useful if you have 3rd party plugins that modify mobs and this                 |
# ||     | gives them a chance to process the mob fist.                                         |
# ||                                                                                            |

# ||     | This setting establishes how far away from a player an entity will spawn             |
# ||     | when you use LevelledMobs' "/lm summon" command.                                     |
# ||     | By default, the radius is 5 blocks.                                                  |
# ||                                                                                            |

# ||     | When using "/lm kill" command, any entity with the following tags set to             |
# ||     | true will automatically be skipped. This is useful to prevent pets or                |
# ||     | other unintended deaths, and it is recommended that you do not adjust                |

# ||       | This system will determine whether LevelledMobs uses the attribute value           |
# ||       | spawned with the entity versus a static value. Some other plugins will             |
# ||       | modify the entity's attributes before LevelledMobs has a chance to apply           |
# ||       | level adjustments, which can cause inaccurate or unintended level values.          |
# ||       | Setting this to true will utilize an internal list of attribute values based       |
# ||       | on the vanilla values. This list provides the identical attribute values           |
# ||       | each time, including things like horse statistics.                                 |

# ||       | Enabling this system will apply LevelledMobs' nametag value as a CustomName,       |
# ||       | instead of faking it with packets as has been done since LM2.X. LevelledMobs       |
# ||       | changed to the packet method to improve compatibility, however there are some      |
# ||       | instances where applying directly to the CustomName will improve compatibility     |
# ||       | with certain plugins. By default, this is set to false.                            |
# ||                                                                                            |

# ||  You should only change these settings by the direction of an official LevelledMobs        |
# ||  developer, as they produce plenty of console spam and could potentially break             |
# ||  your plugin due to an incorrect value.                                                    |
# ||                                                                                            |
# ||  The update task runs asynchronously (Async), and is only conducted once when the          |
# ||  server starts up, and should not affect performance in any way.                           |
# ||                                                                                            |
# ||  The Debug-Misc setting is a very powerful tool to get to the bottom of any potential      |
# ||  issues LevelledMobs might encounter while attempting to apply rules and levels.           |
# ||  It will also report nearly every way LevelledMobs interacts with an entity depending      |
# ||  on which tag you use. The tags listed below consist of the entire tree of possible        |
# ||  options. It is NOT RECOMMENDED that you use this system without direction from a          |
# ||  LevelledMobs Developer while diagnosing any potential issues, and should not be left      |
# ||  on to prevent console-spam.                                                               |
