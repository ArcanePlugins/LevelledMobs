# the plugin offers. Please be careful when adjusting these settings and read the comments

# Creature nametags! These appear above levelled mobs' heads. They use packets to trick the client into thinking
# there is an actual nametag on the entity, but there isn't as LevelledMobs won't touch the actual nametag of the entity.
# You can customize the format of the nametag below! :)
# You can use the following placeholders:
# - %level% - the mob's level
# - %displayname% - the mob's name - will be replaced with the text on its nametag (if the mob is nametagged). -- recommended over %typename%
# - %typename% - the mob's name - this will not show underlying nametags.
# - %health% - the mob's health
# - %health_rounded% - the mob's health, rounded to a whole number
# - %max_health% - the mob's max health
# - %max_health_rounded% - the mob's max health, rounded to a whole number
# - %heart_symbol% - a predefined heart symbol.
# - %tiered% - the color changes depending on the level of the mob.  Higher levels = red, middle = gold and lower levels = green
#
# By default, this is '&8[%tiered%Level %level%&8 | &f%displayname%&8 | &c%health%&8/&c%max_health% %heart_symbol%&8]'.
# Screenshot of the default nametag's appearance: https://prnt.sc/xcckzw
# Set to 'disabled' to disable the levelled nametags.
creature-nametag: '&8[%tiered%Level %level%&8 | &f%displayname%&8 | &c%health%&8/&c%max_health% %heart_symbol%&8]'

# When a player dies this will be the creature name used in the death message.
creature-death-nametag: '&8[&7Level %level%&8 | &f%displayname%&8]'


# Should the nametag above always be visible?
# true = can see the nametag when in range. (warning: also through blocks!)
# false = can see the nametag when very close to it and looking at it
# Unfortunately there is no in-between option as we are limited with what Minecraft provides.
# By default, this is disabled.

# Should passive creatures be levelled?
# You probably don't want a Level 10 race horse to ramp up your chunk loading, or a random pig that moves fast.

# By default, this is disabled.

  # Optional: How many blocks per level.
  # Instead of having a linear level assignment from starting-y-level to ending-y-level, specify how many blocks from starting-y-level the next level will apply
  # for example with a value of 5 and starting-y-level of 100, y-level of 90 will spawn level 2 mobs, y-level 80 will be level 4, and so on
  # Note that by giving y-period a value of higher than 0 effectively nullifies the ending-y-level setting
  # Use a positive integer. By default, this is 0.
