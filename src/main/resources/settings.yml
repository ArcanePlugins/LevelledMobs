# ||  Should nametag packets be ignored if the mob has died?
# ||
# ||     true | Packets will be ignored once the entity has reached zero health.
# ||    false | Packets will continue to be sent once entity has reached zero health.
# ||          | This is not recommended
# ||
# ||  This system attempts to fix any conflicts with plugins similar to ViaBackwards.
# ||  It is not recommended that you change this setting unless you fully
# ||  understand what you are doing.

# ||  Automatic Asynchronous Nametag and Levelling Update
# ||
# ||  This setting will check the area near players for any entities which should have
# ||  been levelled, or are missing their LM attributes for whatever reason.
# ||
# ||  By default, this is set to 6 seconds.
# ||  It is not recommended that you change this setting unless you fully
# ||  understand exactly what you are doing.

# ||  Mob Head Drop Multiplier
# ||
# ||  On some servers, PLAYER_HEADS are too valuable of a resource to be multiplied
# ||  with the standard item drops. That is why this setting exists: to decide
# ||  whether you want head/skull drops to be multiplied alongside the item multiplier.
# ||
# ||   true | PLAYER_HEADS will be multiplied using item-drop value
# ||  false | PLAYER_HEADS will NOT be multipled (Default)

# ||  Miscellaneous LevelledMobs Settings
# ||
# ||   summon-command-spawn-distance-from-player:
# ||     | This setting establishes how far away from a player an entity will spawn
# ||     | when you use LevelledMobs' "/lm summon" command.
# ||     | By default, the radius is 5 blocks.
# ||   kill-skip-conditions:
# ||     | When using '/lm kill' command, any entity with the following tags set to
# ||     | true will automatically be skipped. This is useful to prevent pets or
# ||     | other unintended deaths, and it is recommended that you do not adjust
# ||     | these settings without understanding what you are doing.
# ||     nametagged:
# ||          | Entities with a nametag already applied
# ||     tamed:
# ||          | Entities who have been already tamed
# ||     leashed:
# ||          | Entities currently attached to a leash
# ||     convertingZombieVillager:
# ||          | Zombie Villagers in the process of transforming.
# ||   ensure-mobs-are-levelled-on-chunk-load:
# ||       | This janitor-system runs through all entities in a loaded chunk to ensure
# ||       | entities which *should* be levelled *are* levelled.
# ||       | We recommend that you do not change this setting.

# ||  Updates and Debug Settings
# ||
# ||  You should only change these settings by the direction of an official LevelledMobs
# ||  developer, as they produce plenty of console spam and could potentially break
# ||  your plugin due to an incorrect value.
# ||
# ||  The update task runs asynchronously (Async), and is only conducted once when the
# ||  server starts up, and should not affect performance in any way.
# ||
# ||  The Debug-Misc setting is a very powerful tool to get to the bottom of any potential
# ||  issues LevelledMobs might encounter while attempting to apply rules and levels.
# ||  It will also report nearly every way LevelledMobs interacts with an entity depending
# ||  on which tag you use. The tags listed below consist of the entire tree of possible
# ||  options. It is NOT RECOMMENDED that you use this system without direction from a
# ||  LevelledMobs Developer while diagnosing any potential issues, and should not be left
# ||  on to prevent console-spam.
# ||
# ||          'APPLY_LEVEL_SUCCESS' | Reports when level applied successfully
# ||             'APPLY_LEVEL_FAIL' | Reports when level was not applied
# ||                 'ENTITY_SPAWN' | Reports when an entity has been spawned
# ||   'RANGED_DAMAGE_MODIFICATION' | Reports when LM adjusts ranged damage output
# ||                  'ENTITY_TAME' | Reports when an entity has been tamed
# ||      'SET_LEVELLED_ITEM_DROPS' | Reports when LM adjusts item or experience drops
# ||               'UPDATE_NAMETAG' | Reports when the nametag of an entity was updated
# ||                 'CUSTOM_DROPS' | Reports all CustomDrops related debug options
# ||        'ENTITY_TRANSFORM_FAIL' | Reports when an entity, when transformed, did not receive a level
# ||                  'ENTITY_MISC' | Reports when an unlevelled baby mob has aged and gets levelled
# ||              'CUSTOM_COMMANDS' | Reports all CustomCommands related debug options
# ||                  'MOB_SPAWNER' | Reports entities which have spawned from spawner cube
# ||    'DENIED_RULE_ENTITIES_LIST' | Reports denied levelling due to excluded entity
# ||         'DENIED_RULE_MINLEVEL' | Reports denied levelling due to min level
# ||         'DENIED_RULE_MAXLEVEL' | Reports denied levelling due to max level
# ||       'DENIED_RULE_WORLD_LIST' | Reports denied levelling due to excluded world
# ||       'DENIED_RULE_BIOME_LIST' | Reports denied levelling due to excluded biome
# ||    'DENIED_RULE_PLUGIN_COMPAT' | Reports denied levelling due to plugin compatability
# ||     'DENIED_RULE_SPAWN_REASON' | Reports denied levelling due to 'other' spawn reason
# ||      'DENIED_RULE_CUSTOM_NAME' | Reports denied levelling due to being nametagged
