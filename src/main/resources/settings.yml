# || Dependencies:
# ||  ProtocolLib
# ||   A 'soft dependency': not *required*, but *highly* recommended.
# ||   ProtocolLib is utilised by LevelledMobs to apply custom name
# ||   tags on levelled mobs. Without this, the plugin will
# ||   not show the custom name tags on levelled mobs.

#     On some servers, PLAYER_HEADS are too valuable of

#
#      summon-command-spawn-distance-from-player:
#        | This setting establishes how far away from
#        | a player a mob will spawn when you use the
#        | LevelledMobs '/lm summon' command
#        | By default, the radius is 5 blocks
#      kill-skip-conditions:
#        | When using '/lm kill' command, any mob
#        | with the following tags set to true will
#        | be automatically skipped. This is useful
#        | to prevent pets or other unintended deaths,
#        | and it is recommended that you do not adjust
#        | these settings without understanding what
#        | you are doing
#        nametagged:

#             | the process of transforming
#      ensure-mobs-are-levelled-on-chunk-load:
#          | This makes LM have a janitor run through
#          | all entities in a chunk when a chunk is
#          | loaded on your server to ensure that
#          | the mobs that *should* be levelled,
#          | *are* levelled.
#          | WARNING: If you have 'level-passive' enabled,
#          | DO NOT disable this, since a weird bug we believe
#          | caused by the server software makes only a small
#          | portion of passive mob spawns known to this plugin.
#          | Disabling this could improve performance, although
#          | not much. We recommend you leave this enabled.

# ||  Updates and Debug Settings
#
#     You should only change these settings by the
#     direction of an official LevelledMobs developer,
#     as these could result in a broken plugin, console
#     spam, and terminal config errors if not used as instructed.
#     The update task runs ASYNC and only once at server
#     startup, and should not affect performance.
#     Debug-Misc is a powerful tool to get to the bottom of any
#     potential issues LevelledMobs might have producing the
#     mob you intend. It is not recommended that you enable
#     any of these settings without coordinating with the
#     LevelledMobs developers and support, as they will
#     typically flood your console with messages.
#
#            'APPLY_LEVEL_SUCCESS' | Reports when level applied successfully
#               'APPLY_LEVEL_FAIL' | Reports when level was not applied
#                   'ENTITY_SPAWN' | Reports when an entity has been spawned
#     'RANGED_DAMAGE_MODIFICATION' | Reports when LM adjusts ranged damage output
#                    'ENTITY_TAME' | Reports when an entity has been tamed
