#This allows creature nametags to be updated to the one set above when they are spawned or damaged.
#If you use WildStacker or any other stacking plugins, you might want to disable this, by setting it to 'false'.

#Should passive creatures be levelled?
#You probably don't want a Level 10 race horse to ramp up your chunk loading, or a random pig that moves fast.

#Blacklisted types. These mobs won't be levelled, regardless of the setting above.
#Blacklist all types by putting in 'ALL'.

#Blacklist all worlds by putting in 'ALL'.

  - 'blacklisted_world_here'
  - 'another_blacklisted_world'

#You can block certain spawn reasons from levelling mobs, such as Mob Spawners.
#To block mob spawners from levelling mobs, remove the [] and the hashtag before - 'SPAWNER'.
#This checks for SpawnReasons created by the Spigot API.
#Blacklist all reasons by putting in 'ALL'.
