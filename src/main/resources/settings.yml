# ||  This setting controls the repeating asynchronous nametag

summon-command-spawn-distance-from-player: 5

# ||  Check for updates?
# ||  This is a good update checker - it doesn't freeze

# ||  Should mob heads be multiplied by LevelledMobs'

# || If your server software (e.g. Paper) has
# || the Adventure library in it, then LevelledMobs
# || will use it, so long this setting is enabled.

# || It is recommended that you keep this enabled.
