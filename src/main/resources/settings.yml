#Creature nametags.
# Placeholders:
# - %level% - the mob's level
# - %name% - the mob's name
# - %health% - the mob's health
# - %max_health% - the mob's max health
# - %heart_symbol% - a predefined heart symbol.
creature-nametag: '&8[&7Level %level%&8 | &f%name%&8 | &c%health%&8/&c%max_health% %heart_symbol%&8]'

#This allows creature nametags to be updated to the one set above when they are spawned or damaged.
#If you use WildStacker or any other stacking plugins, you might want to disable this, by setting it to 'false'.
enable-nametag-changes: true

#Should passive creatures be levelled?
#You probably don't want a Level 10 race horse to ramp up your chunk loading, or a random pig that moves fast.
level-passive: false

#Blacklisted types. These mobs won't be levelled, regardless of the setting above.
blacklisted-types:
  - 'VILLAGER'
  - 'WANDERING_TRADER'

  - 'RAVAGER'

#Multiworld support - newly spawned mobs in these worlds won't be levelled.
blacklisted-worlds:
  - 'blacklisted_world_here'
  - 'another_blacklisted_world'

#You can block certain spawn reasons from levelling mobs, such as Mob Spawners.
#To block mob spawners from levelling mobs, remove the [] and the hashtag before - 'SPAWNER'.
#This checks for SpawnReasons created by the Spigot API.
blacklisted-reasons: []
#  - 'SPAWNER'

#Fine-tuning. You probably don't need to change the values in this cluster.

  #For each level, these values are added to a mob. The default have been tried and tested, but you're free to change it.
