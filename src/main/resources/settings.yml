# ||  This is a good update checker - it doesn't freeze
# ||  your server startup since it is asynchronous, it
# ||  only speaks if it found an update, and it only runs

# ||  If your server software (e.g. Paper) has
# ||  the Adventure library in it, then LevelledMobs
# ||  will use it, so long this setting is enabled.
# ||  CraftBukkit and Spigot servers do not have
# ||  this library, although PaperMC servers and
# ||  all PaperMC forks (Airplane, etc) do.
# ||  It is recommended that you keep this enabled.
use-adventure: true

# ||  Do not touch this unless a LM developer tells you to.

# ||  ADVANCED USERS ONLY
# ||  Do not touch this unless a LM developer tells you to.
# ||  This system controls the repeating asynchronous listener which
# ||  maintains the accuracy of levelling and nametag information.
# ||  This is very important and resource sensitive, so it is not
# ||  suggested to alter these settings without testing beforehand.
# ||  This system acts as a garbage collection and verification
# ||  mechanism, as well as a form of 'rechecking' entities to ensure
# ||  they follow the rules of the system.

# ||  a chunk(within given period). Should we send message
# ||  to player to inform him?
exceed-kill-in-chunk-message: true

# ||  This sets a hard limit on the number of entities
# ||  you can summon using the LevelledMobs summon command.
# ||  This is to prevent accidental crashes.

summon-command-spawn-distance-from-player: 5

# ||  Do not touch this unless a LM developer tells you to.

customcommand-amount-limit: 100

# ||  When set to true, nametags will show the mob name

# ||  Should mob heads be multiplied by LevelledMobs'
