#
# This is LevelledMobs' settings configuration file. Here, you can adjust the many features
# the plugin offers. Please be careful when adjusting these settings and read the comments
# that accompany the setting so you know what it does.
#
# Use a YAML parser to check for errors before use: https://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/

# Creature nametags! These appear above levelled mobs' heads. They use packets to trick the client into thinking
# there is an actual nametag on the entity, but there isn't as LevelledMobs won't touch the actual nametag of the entity.
# You can customise the format of the nametag below! :)
# You can use the following placeholders:
# - %level% - the mob's level
# - %displayname% - the mob's name - will be replaced with the text on its nametag (if the mob is nametagged). -- recommended over %typename%
# - %typename% - the mob's name - this will not show underlying nametags.
# - %health% - the mob's health
# - %max_health% - the mob's max health
# - %heart_symbol% - a predefined heart symbol.
# By default, this is '&8[&7Level %level%&8 | &f%displayname%&8 | &c%health%&8/&c%max_health% %heart_symbol%&8]'.
# Screenshot of the default nametag's appearance: https://prnt.sc/xcckzw
creature-nametag: '&8[&7Level %level%&8 | &f%displayname%&8 | &c%health%&8/&c%max_health% %heart_symbol%&8]'

# When a player dies this will be the creature name used in the death message.
creature-death-nametag: '&8[&7Level %level%&8 | &f%displayname%&8]'


# Should the nametag above always be visible?
# true = can see the nametag when in range. (warning: also through blocks!)
# false = can see the nametag when very close to it and looking at it
# Unfortunately there is no in-between option as we are limited with what Minecraft provides.
# By default, this is disabled.
creature-nametag-always-visible: false


# When a levelled mob transforms into another mob (e.g. big slime -> smaller slimes, zombie -> drowned),
# should the transformed mob inherit the level of the original mob?
# By default, this is enabled.
level-inheritance: true


# Should passive creatures be levelled?
# You probably don't want a Level 10 race horse to ramp up your chunk loading, or a random pig that moves fast.
# However, you can always limit passive mobs' levels yourself in the 'entitytype-level-override' list :)
# By default, this is disabled.
level-passive: false


# This list determines what entities are allowed to be levelled.
# These types are case-sensitive, so you must keep them in UPPERCASE.
# You may also use 'BABY_ZOMBIE' to allow/block baby zombies from being levelled.
# By default, this blacklists villagers, wandering traders, ender dragons, withers, ravagers, phantoms and baby zombies.
allowed-entities-list:

  # What mode should the allowed entities list use?
  # 'BLACKLIST' = The entities in the list are blocked, but all the other ones are allowed
  # 'WHITELIST' = The entities in the list are allowed, but all the other ones are blocked

    - ARMOR_STAND


# Any entity types in this list will be force-levelled regardless if they are passive, are in 'allowed entities', and so on.
# These types are case-sensitive, so you must keep them in UPPERCASE.
# You may also use 'BABY_ZOMBIE' to force baby zombies to be levelled.
# By default, this list has commented-out entries (and thus is empty). Remove the '#' character before the entries if you want
# them to take effect.

#  - CREEPER

# In what worlds can levelled mobs spawn?

  variance:

    # Should the levels vary randomly (within min/max limits)?
    # Variation will add/subtract a random amount between min/max numbers set below to the mob's final level.
    # By default, this is enabled.

  increase-level-distance: 200

  # What distance should we start adding levels to mobs?
  # Any mob who spawns under this distance will be level 1 (plus variance if set true)
  # This is only the start so for example, if your increase-level-distance is 200
  # and this value is 1000, mobs won't be level 2 until 1200 blocks out.
  # Use a positive integer. By default, this is 0.

# This system levels mobs depending on their Y-level.
y-distance-levelling:

  # By default, this is disabled.

  # Use a positive integer. By default, this is 100.
  starting-y-level: 100

  # Specify the Y axis that leveled-mobs will end at.  Mobs spawned at and below this y-level will be fully levelled.
  # Use a positive integer. By default, this is 20.
  ending-y-level: 20

  # Optional: How many blocks per level.
  # Instead of having a linear level assignment from starting-y-level to ending-y-level, specify how many blocks from starting-y-level the next level will apply
  # for example with a value of 5 and starting-y-level of 100, y-level of 90 will spawn level 2 mobs, y-level 80 will be level 4, and so on
  # Note that by giving y-period a value of higher than 0 effectively nullifies the ending-y-level setting
  # Use a positive integer. By default, this is 0.
  y-period: 0

  # Optional: add a bit of randomness to the assigned level.  The higher the value here the higher chance of a random level being assigned
  # Use a positive integer. By default, this is 0.
  variance: 0


# If you want to force an entity type to have a different minimum/maximum level then you can do that here.

# Should passive mobs have changed movement speeds?
# Most owners would like this to be disabled, as saddled horses and
# pigs for example of high levels can cause increased chunk loading.
# By default, this is disabled.
passive-mobs-changed-movement-speed: false


# If the mob is the default level, show the label?
# 'false' is more like vanilla minecraft if the mob is at the default level.

# What should the maxed out creeper explosion radius be?

# By default, this is 5.
creeper-max-damage-radius: 5


# Should LevelledMobs check for updates off of the Spigot page?
# Following annoyances from other plugins' update checkers, LM's update checker just does its job nicely.
# - This update checker is async, meaning it won't freeze your server whilst it checks. (separate CPU thread)
# - It will only send a message to console if it found an update. You won't get spammed.
# - It will only run once on startup. No repeating tasks or anything like that.
# By default, this is enabled.
use-update-checker: true

# ******************************************************************************
# TEST CHANGES ON A SECONDARY TEST SERVER BEFORE APPLYING TO YOUR MAIN SERVER :)
# ******************************************************************************
# This section allows you to make levelled mobs easier or harder.
# These values have been tried and tested already, so most server owners won't need to change anything here.
fine-tuning:

  # *** WARNING ***
  # Changing the min &/or max levels below will not scale the additions section below!
  # This means if you change the min/max levels below, then you will also need to change the additions values!
  # It is *highly* recommended that you test changes in this section on a test server before applying it to your main server.
  # *** WARNING ***

  # The minimum level possible for all mobs (unless overriden)
  # Use a positive integer. By default, this is 1.
  min-level: 1

  # The maximum level possible for all mobs (unless overriden)
  # Use a positive integer. By default, this is 10.
  max-level: 10

  # Per-level, these numbers are added to a levelled mob's attributes.
  # Math:                Old Attribute + (Addition * Level) = New Attribute
  # e.g. a Lvl.2 Zombie:      0.23     +    (0.01  *   2)   = a movement speed of 0.25
  additions:

    # Additions to Minecraft's attributes

      # **IMPORTANT**
      # Movement speed should be increased in very, very small amounts! (i.e. 0.001 - 0.005 each time)
      # This is because Minecraft uses very small numbers for movement speeds.
      # The default value here is already pretty high, so I would not recommend going higher than what it already is.
