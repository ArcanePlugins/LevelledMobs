# LevelledMobs - The Ultimate RPG Levelled Mobs Solution

# These nametags are applied to levelled mobs. You can change the format of it here:
# You can use the following placeholders:
# - %level% - the mob's level
# - %name% - the mob's name
# - %health% - the mob's health
# - %max_health% - the mob's max health
# - %heart_symbol% - a predefined heart symbol.
# Warning: The 'slime-children-retain-level-of-parent' setting requires the %level% placeholder to be used.
creature-nametag: '&8[&7Level %level%&8 | &f%name%&8]'


# Should passive creatures be levelled?
# You probably don't want a Level 10 race horse to ramp up your chunk loading, or a random pig that moves fast.
# However, you can always limit passive mobs' levels yourself in the 'entitytype-level-override' list :)
# By default, passive mobs are not levelled.
level-passive: false


# This list determines what entities are allowed to be levelled.
# These types are case-sensitive, so you must keep them in UPPERCASE.
# You may also use 'BABY_ZOMBIE' to allow/block baby zombies from being levelled.
# By default, this blacklists villagers, wandering traders, ender dragons, withers, ravagers, phantoms and baby zombies.
allowed-entities-list:

  # What mode should the allowed entities list use?
  # 'BLACKLIST' = The entities in the list are blocked, but all the other ones are allowed
  # 'WHITELIST' = The entities in the list are allowed, but all the other ones are blocked
  # 'ALL' = This list is skipped, and all worlds are allowed.
  mode: 'ALL'

    - WANDERING_TRADER
    - ENDER_DRAGON
    - WITHER

# Any entity types in this list will be force-levelled regardless if they are passive, are in 'allowed entities', and so on.
# These types are case-sensitive, so you must keep them in UPPERCASE.
# You may also use 'BABY_ZOMBIE' to force baby zombies to be levelled.
# By default, this list is empty.

# This system levels mobs depending on their distance to spawn.
spawn-distance-levelling:

  # Should monsters level depending on distance to spawn?
  # Expected: [Boolean], Default: [false]
  active: false

  # Should the level be able to randomly increase or decrease (within min/max limits) for variation?
  variance:

    # Should the levels vary randomly (within min/max limits)?
    # Variation will add/subtract a random amount between min/max numbers set below to the mob's final level.
    enabled: true

    # The minimum amount of variance.
    # Expected: [Integer], Default: [0]
    min: 0

    # The maximum amount of variance.
    # Expected: [Integer], Default: [2]
    max: 2

  # The level will be increased by 1 per the number defined below.
  # By default, every 200 blocks, the mob's level will increase by 1.
  # Expected: [Integer], Default: [200]
  increase-level-distance: 200

  # What distance should we start adding levels to mobs?
  # Any mob who spawns under this distance will be level 1 (plus variance if set true)
  # This is only the start so for example, if your increase-level-distance is 200
  # and this value is 1000, mobs won't be level 2 until 1200 blocks out.
  # Expected: [Integer], Default: [0]
  start-distance: 0


# This system levels mobs depending on their Y-level.
y-distance-levelling:

  # Should monsters level depending on the Y level they spawn in as configured below?
  # Note that you can't use y-distance-leveling AND spawn-distance-levelling enabled at the same time.
  # Expected: [Boolean], Default: [false]
  active: false

  # Specify the Y axis that leveled-mobs will start at.  Mobs spawned at and below this y-level will be level 1.
  # Expected: [Integer], Default: [0]
  starting-y-level: 100

  # Specify the Y axis that leveled-mobs will end at.  Mobs spawned at and above this y-level will be fully levelled.
  # Expected: [Integer], Default: [20]
  ending-y-level: 20

  # Optional: Instead of having a linear level assignment from starting-y-level to ending-y-level, specify how many blocks from starting-y-level the next level will apply
  # for example with a value of 5 and starting-y-level of 20, y-level of 30 will spawn level 2 mobs, y-level 40 will be level 4, and so on
  # Note that by giving y-period a value of higher than 0 effectively nullifies the ending-y-level setting
  # Expected: [Integer], Default: [0]
  y-period: 0

  # Optional: at a bit of randomness to the assigned level.  The higher the value here the higher chance of a random level being assigned
  # Expected: [Integer], Default: [0]
  variance: 0

# *** It is not recommended that you touch any of these values unless you have tested them on a test server beforehand. ***
# This section allows you to make levelled mobs easier or harder.
# These values have been tried and tested already.
fine-tuning:

  # *** WARNING ***
  # Changing the min &/or max levels below will not scale the additions section below!
  # This means if you change the min/max levels below, then you will also need to change the additions values!
  # It is *highly* recommended that you test changes in this section on a test server before applying it to your main server.

  # The minimum level possible for all mobs (unless overriden)
  # Expected: [Integer], Default: [1]
  min-level: 1

  # The maximum level possible for all mobs (unless overriden)
  # Expected: [Integer], Default: [10]
  max-level: 10

  # Per-level, these numbers are added to a levelled mob's attributes.
  # Math:                Old Attribute + (Addition * Level) = New Attribute
  # e.g. a Lvl.2 Zombie:      0.23     +    (0.01  *   2)   = a movement speed of 0.25
  additions:

    # Additions to Minecraft's attributes

      # **IMPORTANT**
      # Movement speed should be increased in very, very small amounts! (i.e. 0.001 - 0.005 each time)
      # This is because Minecraft uses very small numbers for movement speeds.
      # The default value here is already pretty high, so I would not recommend going higher than what it already is.
