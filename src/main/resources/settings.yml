# ||
# || Dependencies:
# ||  ProtocolLib
# ||   A 'soft dependency': not *required*, but *highly* recommended.
# ||   ProtocolLib is utilised by LevelledMobs to apply custom name
# ||   tags on levelled mobs. Without this, the plugin will
# ||   not show the custom name tags on levelled mobs.

# ||  Should Level 1 mobs display a nametag?
#
#        true | Default-Levelled mobs
#             | will display a nametag (Default)
#       false | Default-Levelled mobs
#             | will NOT display a nametag
# ||-------------------------------------------------------||
show-label-for-default-levelled-mobs: true

# ||  ADVANCED USERS ONLY
# ||  Should nametag packets be ignored if the mob has died?
#
#        true | Packets will be ignored once the
#             | mob has reached zero health
#       false | Packets will continue to be sent
#             | when mob has reached zero health
#             | This is not recommended
#
#     This system attempts to fix any conflicts with
#     plugins similar to ViaBackwards. It is not
#     recommended that you change this setting unless

# ||  Automatic Asynchronous Nametag and Levelling Update
#
#     This setting will check the area near players for
#     any entities which should be levelled or are missing
#     their correct nametags for whatever reason.
#     
#     By default, this is set to 6 seconds.
#     It is not recommended that you change this setting
#     unless you understand exactly what you are doing.

# ||  Mob Head Drop Multiplier
#
#     On some servers, PLAYER_HEADS are too valuable of
#     a resource to be multiplied with the standard
#     item drops. That's why this setting exists, to
#     decide whether you want to multiply.
#
#      true | PLAYER_HEADS will be multiplied
#           | using item-drop set below
#     false | PLAYER_HEADS will NOT be multipled (Default)

# ||  Miscellaneous LevelledMobs Settings
#
#      summon-command-spawn-distance-from-player:
#        | This setting establishes how far away from
#        | a player a mob will spawn when you use the
#        | LevelledMobs '/lm summon' command
#        | By default, the radius is 5 blocks
#      kill-skip-conditions:
#        | When using '/lm kill' command, any mob
#        | with the following tags set to true will
#        | be automatically skipped. This is useful
#        | to prevent pets or other unintended deaths,
#        | and it is recommended that you do not adjust
#        | these settings without understanding what
#        | you are doing
#        nametagged:
#             | Mobs with a nametag appplied
#        tamed:
#             | Mobs who have been tamed
#        leashed:
#             | Mobs currently attached to a leash
#        convertingZombieVillager:
#             | Zombie Villagers in
#             | the process of transforming
#      ensure-mobs-are-levelled-on-chunk-load:
#          | This makes LM have a janitor run through
#          | all entities in a chunk when a chunk is
#          | loaded on your server to ensure that
#          | the mobs that *should* be levelled,
#          | *are* levelled.
#          | WARNING: If you have 'level-passive' enabled,
#          | DO NOT disable this, since a weird bug we believe
#          | caused by the server software makes only a small
#          | portion of passive mob spawns known to this plugin.
#          | Disabling this could improve performance, although
#          | not much. We recommend you leave this enabled.

# ||  Updates and Debug Settings
#
#     You should only change these settings by the
#     direction of an official LevelledMobs developer,
#     as these could result in a broken plugin, console
#     spam, and terminal config errors if not used as instructed.
#     The update task runs ASYNC and only once at server
#     startup, and should not affect performance.
#     Debug-Misc is a powerful tool to get to the bottom of any
#     potential issues LevelledMobs might have producing the
#     mob you intend. It is not recommended that you enable
#     any of these settings without coordinating with the
#     LevelledMobs developers and support, as they will
#     typically flood your console with messages.
#
