# ||-------------------------------------------------------||
#     These creature nametags appear above the levelled
#     mobs head, using packets to emulate a nametag
#     without actually applying one to the mob to
#     prevent conflicts with other plugins.
#     This means the client is essentially 'tricked'
#     into thinking the mob has that nametag, but
#     the server itself has no idea that is the case.
#
#     You can use the following placeholders when
#     crafting your creatures nametag:
#                   %level% | The mobs current level
#             %displayname% | The mobs name; will show
#                           | nametag name if tagged (recommended)
#                %typename% | The mobs name; will NOT show
#                           | nametag name if tagged
#                  %health% | The mobs current health in decimal form
#          %health_rounded% | The mobs current health,
#                           | rounded to nearest whole number
#              %max_health% | The mobs max health
#      %max_health_rounded% | The mobs max health,
#                           | rounded to nearest whole number
#            %heart_symbol% | A predefined heart character symbol
#                  %tiered% | Color text based on the level of the mob
#
#     You can disable the nametag system entirely by
#     changing the creature-nametag to 'disabled'
#     If a player dies to a mob, creature-death-nametag
#     name will be used for any death messages.
# ||-------------------------------------------------------||
creature-nametag: '&8[%tiered%Level %level%&8 | &f%displayname%&8 | &c%health%&8/&c%max_health% %heart_symbol%&8]'
creature-death-nametag: '&8[&7Level %level%&8 | &f%displayname%&8]'


# ||-------------------------------------------------------||
# ||  Should the nametag always be visible?
#
#       true | The nametags are always visible, even
#            | through blocks, when you enter their range
#      false | The nametags remain hidden until you are
#            | fairly close and looking directly at it (Default)
#
#     As much as we would like to have a 'you can see the
#     nametag if you can see the mob' option, unfortunately
#     Minecraft itself limits us to just these two options.

# ||  Customize Mob Names
#
#     If you wish to change the name of mobs used for
#     nametags, you can do so below. You can disable the
#     mobs nametag by changing it to 'disabled', as well
#     as impliment Minecraft's color codes.
#
#     The format below consists of the mob name, and
#     their replacement name.

# ||  ADVANCED USERS ONLY
# ||  Fine Tuning Settings for Levelling Mob Attributes
#
#     These default settings used below have been well
#     tested to work well for the default configuration
#     If you increase your Maximum level, you will want
#     to make adjustments to the following settings in
#     order to preserve proper difficulty scaling, and
#     prevent situations where mobs become unkillable or
#     unfairly difficult to the player. Every server
#     design and plugin layout is different, so this section
#     gives you near absolute control over how your mobs
#     level. You are even given the ability to make
#     per-mod adjustments at the end for higher flexibility.
#     Note that few of these values take effect on existing
#     levelled mobs, you may want to run '/lm kill all *' if
#     you want to clear old levelled mobs and let the new ones
#     spawn in.
#
#      fine-tuning:
#        min-level:
#             | The minimum level that mobs
#             | will naturally spawn at.
#             | Note: this value is safe to change,
#             | avoid huge numbers. Ask a dev if unsure.
#        max-level:
#             | The maximum level that mobs
#             | will naturally spawn at.
#             | Note: this value is safe to change,
#             | avoid huge numbers. Ask a dev if unsure.
#        lower-mob-level-bias-factor:
#             | This setting will make lower-level mobs
#             | spawn more frequently when higher than 0
#             | The value can be any number between
#             | 0 (Disabled) or 10
#        additions:
#             | This is where LevelledMobs makes mobs more difficult.
#             | Check the FAQ page on the Wiki to learn how it works.
#             | Set any of these values to zero to disable it.
#          max-health:
#               | This is the maximum health that can be
#               | added to a naturally generated mob
#               | Remember, your server jar may include
#               | settings which set artificial limits on
#               | The max-health of a mob. Make sure
#               | to check your server settings files for any
#               | imposed caps, as we cannot circumvent that.
#          movement-speed:
#               | This is the maximum movement
#               | speed added to a mob.
#               | This setting is HIGHLY sensative to any edits.
#               | It is recommended that you make adjustments
#               | no larger than 0.03, and do not increase the
#               | speed beyond 0.15, as the mobs become too fast
#               | for the Minecraft AI to be at all effective.
#          attack-damage:
#               | This is the maximum additional attack
#               | damage added to mob attacks.
#               | This by default makes the highest level
#               | mob deal 4 extra hearts of damage than normal.
#          ranged-attack-damage:
#               | This is the maximum additional ranged
#               | attack damage added to mob attacks
#               | This setting is HIGHLY sensative to any change.
#               | It is recommended that you make adjustments
#               | no larger than 0.25 at a time
#          item-drop:
#               | This is a multiplier applied to every
#               | mob item that drops upon their demise.
#               | You can made additional adjustments to
#               | specific items multiplied in customdrops.yml.
#          xp-drop:
#               | This is a multiplier applied to all xp

# ||  External Plugin Compatibility
#
#     By default, all compatibilities are set to true.
#     It is recommended that you do not change these
#     settings without understanding what you are doing.
#     Disabling a compatibility will allow LevelledMobs to
#     apply levels to the creatures spawned by that plugin.

#
#  || IMPORTANT:
#  |  If you have 'DANGEROUS_CAVES' set to 'true' below,

#
#      summon-command-spawn-distance-from-player:
#        | This setting establishes how far away from
#        | a player a mob will spawn when you use the
#        | LevelledMobs '/lm summon' command
#        | By default, the radius is 5 blocks
#      kill-skip-conditions:
#        | When using '/lm kill' command, any mob
#        | with the following tags set to true will
#        | be automatically skipped. This is useful
#        | to prevent pets or other unintended deaths,
#        | and it is recommended that you do not adjust
#        | these settings without understanding what
#        | you are doing
#        nametagged:
#             | Mobs with a nametag appplied
#        tamed:
#             | Mobs who have been tamed
#        leashed:
#             | Mobs currently attached to a leash
#        convertingZombieVillager:
#             | Zombie Villagers in
#             | the process of transforming
#      ensure-mobs-are-levelled-on-chunk-load:
#          | This makes LM have a janitor run through
#          | all entities in a chunk when a chunk is
#          | loaded on your server to ensure that
#          | the mobs that *should* be levelled,
#          | *are* levelled.
#          | WARNING: If you have 'level-passive' enabled,
#          | DO NOT disable this, since a weird bug we believe
#          | caused by the server software makes only a small
#          | portion of passive mob spawns known to this plugin.
#          | Disabling this could improve performance, although
#          | not much. We recommend you leave this enabled.

#     The update task runs ASYNC and only once at server
#     startup, and should not affect performance.
