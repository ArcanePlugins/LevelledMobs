# ||  ADVANCED USERS ONLY | DEBUG

debug-entity-damage: false
debug-misc: [ ]

# ||  ADVANCED USERS ONLY
# ||  Do not touch this unless a LM developer tells you to.
# ||  This setting controls the repeating asynchronous nametag
# ||  and player-levelling value update task's delay. The longer,
# ||  the less CPU operation but worse user experience. Vice-versa.
# ||  Best to keep it at the default of 6 seconds.

# ||  ADVANCED USERS ONLY | IRREVERSIBLE

# ||  Check for updates?
# ||  This is a good update checker - it doesn't freeze
