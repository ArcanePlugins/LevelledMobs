- Mob attributes were given the wrong value. The 'multipliers' section of the settings didn't really function like multipliers, but now they do.
 - Thus the values have been drastically lowered.

 - These values have been tried and tested by me for a while with all ten mob levels working well.
- [issue #27] added multiworld support for newly spawned mobs.
- [issue #28] you can now exclude mob spawners from creating levelled mobs.
- improved the file management system.

1.21-RELEASE
 Big thanks to Eyrian for once again making a great contribution to the plugin. I highly appreciate people putting in contributions to help me maintain the plugin whilst I'm learning Java and struggling with time.
- [pull #34] merged pull request by Eyrian
 - [issue #4] Added a drops multiplier, as suggested by Dralga ツ#1339
   Eyrian has added in a 'drops multiplier', meaning, as a mob's level increases, their drops do too.
   This multiplier is customisable in the settings file. The default value should be good - send me a message if you've found something that you recon would be better as a default value.
 - Renamed 'LTagUpdate' to 'LMobDamage' to better represent what the class does.
- added a new subcommand, /levelledMobs info. neatens up the main command more.
- added more to the code comments. tried my best to explain my class naming convention and how to use the file library. i'm surprised Eyrian managed to figure it out without any input from me whatsoever.
- added more to the config comments.
- settings.yml was updated to version 13.

1.22-RELEASE
- Fixed max stack size not being taken into consideration when multiplying drops
- Fixed incorrect failsafe-default in drop multiplier
