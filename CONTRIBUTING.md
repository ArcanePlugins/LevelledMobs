# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you very much for taking the time to contribute to LevelledMobs!

We aim to ensure LevelledMobs releases are as stable as possible for every user, so contributors help us very much in achieving this.

We don't classify *contributing* as only done by those who submit code! Testing, Wiki writing, videos, and voluntary support are other forms of contribution. All help the project tremendously.

Before you contribute, please read this document.

## Test Contributions

Testing is the easiest form of contribution (as it only requires intermediate Minecraft server administration skills), but it is also the most beneficial form of contribution to the project.

Testing can be whatever you want it to be. Giving LM a whirl for 15 minutes to see if the out-of-the-box configuration works correctly, or even turning the plugin inside out to try spot bugs or missing features that would be nice to have.

The greatest way to test LevelledMobs is by watching for when new snapshot/dev-builds come out - test anything that's made its way into the changelog of the build. For example, if a build adds a new command in, test if that command works - and see if you can make some purposeful mistakes to try break it. Report back your findings to LevelledMobs maintainers (even if it worked perfectly fine).

We have no testing procedure, go about it however you want. Though, when you report your findings, please also inform us which version you are running, and (if applicable) any changes to the configuration you have made.
