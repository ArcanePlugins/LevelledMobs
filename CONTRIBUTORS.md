# For Contributors
I would appreciate if contributors follow these in order to save time cleaning up code from PRs.

* Please use curly braces everywhere. Use `if(cond) { do; }` instead of `if(cond) do`;
* Although other regions of the world spell 'leveled' (2 'l' characters), this resource uses 3 characters: 'levelled'. Please use the same spelling. (Australian English)
* Please provide a comment to whatever degree you wish explaining what your method does if it isn't self explanatory. This is so other contributors and myself understand how it functions.
* Please do not commit any IDE settings change unless you feel they are a significant improvement.
* Please do not have your IDE automatically rearrange code (unless what you are rearranging is messy)

Completely optional as I will go over the code myself and fix what doesn't abide by these requests, but it would be helpful if contributors followed.

Any contributions must fall under the same license.
