# For Contributors
I would appreciate if contributors follow these in order to save time cleaning up code from PRs.

# Code
* Where `else` statements are included, please use curly brackets (`{`, `}`) to maintain a clear structure of the code.
* Include javadocs and comments to your code wherever possible, unless it is obviously self-explanatory (e.g. 'changeWoolColor(Block)`)
* Please do not commit any personal IDE settings change unless you feel they are a significant improvement.
* Do not use automatic code re-arranging from your IDE. We've purposely laid out methods and variables in certain areas, and functions such as IntelliJ's 'relocate code' mess with it.

# Language
Wherever possible, use American English (`en-us`) spelling, with exception to the name, 'LevelledMobs', which was spelt originally with Australian English (`en-au`) and shall continue to be, to prevent breaking any resources which depend on this spelling.

# Ownership
* Any contributions must fall under the same license described in `LICENSE.md`.
* You are expected to own or clearly credit the code you have contributed.

# Conclusion
Although following this guide is optional, it is highly appreciated by the developers of the resource, since we will have to fix or even reject contributions that don't follow it.
