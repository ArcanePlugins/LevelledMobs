# For Contributors
We would *highly* appreciate if contributors followed these requests, as it will save the lead developers a lot of time having to clean up PRs.

# Musts
* Where `else` statements are included, please use curly brackets (`{`, `}`) to maintain a clear structure of the code.
* Include javadocs and comments to your code wherever possible, unless it is obviously self-explanatory (e.g. 'changeWoolColor(Block)`)
* Please do not commit any personal IDE settings change unless you feel they are a significant improvement.
* Do not use automatic code re-arranging from your IDE. We've purposely laid out methods and variables in certain areas, and functions such as IntelliJ's 'relocate code' mess with it.

# Language

Wherever possible, use American English (`en-us`) spelling, with exception to the name, `LevelledMobs`, which was spelt
originally with Australian English (`en-au`) and shall continue to be, to prevent breaking any resources which depend on
this spelling. American English uses `leveled` (two total `l` characters), compared to Australian English's `levelled` (
three total `l` characters). Sorry for this confusion!

# Ownership of Code

* Any contributions must fall under the same license described in `LICENSE.md`.
* You are expected to own or clearly credit the code you have contributed. Check the license of copied code beforehand.

# Conclusion
Although following this guide is optional, it is highly appreciated by the developers of the resource, since we will have to fix or even reject contributions that don't follow it.
