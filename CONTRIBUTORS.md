# For Contributors
I would appreciate if contributors follow these in order to save time cleaning up code from PRs.

* Please use curly braces everywhere. Use `if(cond) { do; }` instead of `if(cond) do`;
* Where I live (Australia), it is spelt 'levelled', not 'leveled' (e.g. USA). Since the plugin name and all other uses of the word in this resource are spelt the first way, please follow with the same spelling.
* Please provide a comment to whatever degree you wish explaining what your method does if it isn't self explanatory. This is so other contributors and myself understand how it functions.
* Please do not commit any IDE settings change unless you feel they are a significant improvement.

Completely optional as I will go over the code myself and fix what doesn't abide by these requests, but it would be helpful if contributors followed.
