# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release version of the resource will be supported by the LevelledMobs team.

Older versions will not receive updates or support.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If LevelledMobs has a security vulnerability, please contact the LM team in a manner that is not
visible to the public to avoid immediate exploitation. [Sending a PM to lokka30 on SpigotMC.org](https://www.spigotmc.org/conversations/add?to=lokka30) is the most ideal option.
