## About

### Minecraft's mobs, on 'hard' difficulty, are so darn easy!

This is where LevelledMobs comes to shine on your server, by upgrading the PvE experience for mobs. LevelledMobs applies a level through customizable formulas to every newly spawned mob on your server - the higher the level, the higher the stats, the more difficult a mob is to fight. Harder, better, faster and stronger, all completely automatic!

It can hook with your favourite plugins, such as *EcoSkills*, *Aurelium Skills*, *mcMMO*, *WorldGuard*, and far more.
